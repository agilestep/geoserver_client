# geoserver_client

> A simple gem to control your GeoServer installation using the REST API

## Introduction

There is a very good gem to interact with the GeoServer API: [rgeoserver](https://github.com/sul-dlss/rgeoserver)
which I decided not to use because I wanted a more light-weight, simpler alternative and I prefer to use
HttpClient in general.

This gem was created for my own limited interactions with GeoServer and the `geoserver_migrations` gem.
